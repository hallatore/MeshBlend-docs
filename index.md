**If it's a mesh, we can blend it**

MeshBlend is an Unreal Engine plugin enabling controllable blending of meshes. It's been battle tested and is currently used in real projects with different art styles and requirements ranging from Indie to AAA titles.

MeshBlend supports many different use cases like games, offline rendering cinematics and virtual production. It balances performance, visual quality and artist workflow.
