# Roadmap

MeshBlend is a complex system and I've been working on for one and a half year. My main focus is to release a stable first release and build on that. There are tons of things I would love to add/support eventually.

## Things coming later

ðŸš€ **Even better performance** - Do the heavy parts of the shader in a downsampled pass, bringing high quality blending to all target platforms.

ðŸŽ¨ **Support Substrate** - Support substrate materials the same way normal materials are supported.

ðŸª„ **Easier setup** - Make it easier to setup the shader patching without having to manually edit engine files.
